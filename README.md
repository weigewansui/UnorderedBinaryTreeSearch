# UnorderedBinaryTreeSearch
This is the code for binary tree search.

Different from common search algorithm, this algorithm is able to insert a node into either child of a parent without camparing the numbers.

Additionally, users are enabled to insert a new child to any node without losing the parent's previous children. Arbitrarily deleting a node can also be complete through SuperErase() with providing choices of dealing with its children to users.
